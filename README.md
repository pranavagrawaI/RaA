# Reproducibility as Accuracy (RaA) Benchmark

> ⚠️ this is a work in progress.

RaA is framework to evaluate information fidelity in iterative multimodal transformations. RaA assesses how well AI models preserve semantic content as data “loops” between different modalities, quantifying drift and degeneration.

---

### Overview

 **Goal**: Measure semantic drift and information degradation when an image is converted to text, then back to an image (I→T→I) over multiple iterations.
 
 **Key Outcomes**:

 - **Open‐Source Toolkit**: Python‐based modules for orchestrating iterative transformations.
 - **Evaluation Suite**: Prebuilt metrics (LPIPS, BERT, BLIP, etc.) to quantify drift.
 - **Datasets & Protocols**: Integrated data with standardized loops and seed management.
 - **Configurable**: Customize and use with a variety of models, data, and evaluations from a single config file.
 - **Documentation & Reports**: Step‐by‐step guides, example scripts, and analytical reports highlighting patterns of degradation.
