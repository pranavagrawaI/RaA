# Prompt template for image captioning and generation
prompts:
  caption: |-
    Describe this image in detailed, structured prose so that another model could reproduce it as faithfully as possible. Your description **must** include:
    • Primary subject(s) - identity, count, appearance, pose, expression
    • Secondary objects - any items or beings within the frame and their relation to the subject
    • Scene setting - indoor/outdoor, environment, lighting conditions, time of day
    • Color palette - dominant and notable colours of all main elements
    • Composition - camera angle, framing, perspective, depth cues, object placement
    • Style indicators - if artistic, specify medium (e.g., watercolor, digital painting); if photographic, note lens/filters (if guessable)
    • Textures & materials - of major surfaces (e.g., skin, fabric, metal, grass)
    • Mood or atmosphere - if emotionally evocative
    Do **not** omit details due to assumed irrelevance. Write as if the description will be used to reconstruct the image from scratch.

    Recreate the image described below with maximum visual fidelity. Prioritise spatial arrangement, visual details, and scene structure exactly as specified. Do not stylise unless explicitly instructed.
