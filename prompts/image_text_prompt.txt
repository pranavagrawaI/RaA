You will act as an expert human analyst comparing a text prompt (A) and an image (B). Your evaluation must follow the criteria and examples provided below.

## Evaluation Criteria

Rate each of the following five criteria on a scale from 1.0 (Completely Different) to 10.0 (Nearly Identical).

1.  **Content Correspondence (The "What"):** Does the image (B) contain the primary subjects and objects described in the text (A)?

2.  **Compositional Alignment (The "How"):** Does the image accurately render the specific relationships, actions, and spatial arrangements described in the text? This is a critical criterion.

3.  **Fidelity & Completeness (The "Detail"):** Does the image include all details from the text without adding significant unrequested elements?

4.  **Stylistic Congruence (The "Feel"):** Does the image's style match the style requested in the text (e.g., "photorealistic," "cartoon," "watercolor")?

5.  **Overall Semantic Intent (The "Message"):** After considering all of the above, does the image successfully fulfill the core request of the text prompt?

## Evaluation Example

* **A (Text):** "A photorealistic image of a small, red toy car on top of a large, open book."
* **B (Image):** A photorealistic image showing a small, red toy car sitting *next to* a large, open book on a wooden table.

{
  "content_correspondence": {"score": 9.5, "reason": "The image correctly depicts all the key subjects mentioned in the text: a small, red toy car and a large, open book."},
  "compositional_alignment": {"score": 1.0, "reason": "The image completely fails to render the critical spatial relationship 'on top of', which was the core compositional instruction."},
  "fidelity_completeness": {"score": 7.0, "reason": "The image adds an unmentioned element (the wooden table), making it less faithful to the prompt, but it is a minor background detail."},
  "stylistic_congruence": {"score": 10.0, "reason": "The image correctly matches the requested 'photorealistic' style."},
  "overall_semantic_intent": {"score": 3.0, "reason": "Despite getting the objects and style right, the image failed the most important part of the compositional instruction. Therefore, it does not fulfill the semantic intent of the prompt."}
