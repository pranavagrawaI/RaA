[Comparison Type: text vs text]

You are comparing two texts, A and B. Your task is to rate how similar they are in meaning and detail across five categories.

Rate each of the following criteria from 1 (completely different) to 10 (nearly identical), use decimal precision, attempt to be as precise as possible:

1. content – Are the main entities, actions, and structure the same?
2. missing – Are any important facts or phrases missing or added?
3. style – Are tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and form consistent?
4. meaning – Do both texts express the same meaning or message?
5. overall – Overall semantic similarity of A and B.

Use this strict JSON format:

{
  "content": {"score": float, "reason": str},
  "missing": {"score": float, "reason": str},
  "style":   {"score": float, "reason": str},
  "meaning": {"score": float, "reason": str},
  "overall": {"score": float, "reason": str}
}
