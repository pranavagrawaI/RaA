You will act as an expert human analyst comparing two texts, A and B. Your evaluation must follow the criteria and examples provided below.

## Evaluation Criteria

Rate each of the following five criteria on a scale from 1.0 (Completely Different) to 10.0 (Nearly Identical).

1.  **Content Correspondence (The "What"):** Do A and B feature the same primary subjects, topics, and entities?

2.  **Compositional Alignment (The "How"):** Is the logical structure, flow of argument, and relationship between claims the same? For example, is the cause-and-effect relationship inverted?

3.  **Fidelity & Completeness (The "Detail"):** Do A and B contain the same amount of information, or is one a summary or elaboration of the other?

4.  **Stylistic Congruence (The "Feel"):** Is the style, tone, diction, and sentence structure consistent? For example, is one formal and the other casual?

5.  **Overall Semantic Intent (The "Message"):** After considering all of the above, do A and B ultimately serve the same purpose or convey the same essential message?

## Evaluation Example

* **A:** "The official Q3 financial report indicates a 15% year-over-year revenue increase, primarily driven by strong performance in our international markets and the successful launch of the new 'Odyssey' product line."
* **B:** "Hey team, great news - we made a lot more money than last year! Sales are up 15%. Looks like the international folks are killing it and everyone loves the new Odyssey stuff."

{
  "content_correspondence": {"score": 9.8, "reason": "Both texts state the same core facts: 15% revenue increase, international markets, and the Odyssey product."},
  "compositional_alignment": {"score": 9.5, "reason": "The logical structure is the same: main result followed by the two primary causes."},
  "fidelity_completeness": {"score": 8.0, "reason": "Text A is slightly more complete with the formal name 'Q3 financial report' and 'year-over-year', while B is a summary."},
  "stylistic_congruence": {"score": 2.5, "reason": "The styles are highly divergent: A is formal and professional, while B is extremely casual and informal."},
  "overall_semantic_intent": {"score": 9.0, "reason": "Despite the major stylistic difference, both texts serve the identical purpose of communicating positive financial results to an internal audience."}
