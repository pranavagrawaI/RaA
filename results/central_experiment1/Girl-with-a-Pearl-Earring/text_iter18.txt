*   She wears a blue and gold turban-like head covering and a pearl earring is seen on her right ear. Her expression is one of direct, inquisitive gaze.

**Secondary Objects:**

*   On the left side of the frame, there's a small dark wooden table or surface.
*   On the table is a glass bottle filled with dark blackberries and sealed with a cork. Next to the bottle, a small glass tumbler has fallen on its side, also spilling blackberries onto the table.
*   The blackberries are deep black in color.

**Scene Setting:**

*   The setting is a studio or indoor environment, suggested by the solid black background.

**Color Palette:**

*   Dominant colors: Black, blue, gold, red, and deep shades of brown.
