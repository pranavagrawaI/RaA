He also has an orange garland or scarf draped around his neck. His expression is joyful and energetic, with a broad smile. He is seated atop another person's shoulders (unseen), and is holding two wooden drumsticks aloft in both hands, as if in the middle of playing a drum.

**Secondary objects:**

*   A large, two-headed drum (dhol) hangs on his front.
*   Numerous other people surround him, predominantly men wearing turbans of various colors, including orange, black, maroon, and pink. They are packed closely together. Many of them are looking towards the main subject. Some are taking pictures with their phones.
*   Indian flags are visible in the background.
*   There are building in the background, with signs on the buildings written in what looks like Hindi.

**Scene setting:**

*   The scene appears to be an outdoor street procession or festival.
*   The environment seems urban, with buildings lining both sides of the street. There is some haze or smoke in the air, possibly from firecrackers or dust.
*   The lighting is diffused and overcast, creating a soft, even illumination. It appears to be daytime.

**Color palette:**

*   Dominant colors are orange (turbans, scarf), yellow (shirt), brown (drum, buildings), and variations of skin tones.
*   The Indian flags introduce white, green, and blue into the color scheme.
*   The overall palette is warm and earthy.

**Composition:**

*   The camera angle is at eye level with the main subject, providing a slightly elevated perspective due to the subject being on someone's shoulders.

*   It is likely a documentary or street photography style.

**Textures & materials:**

*   Skin: Smooth, with visible pores and facial hair.
*   Fabric (turban, shirt, trousers): Texturized, but the precise weave is not discernible due to the distance.
*   Wood (drum, drumsticks): Grainy, smooth surfaces with noticeable wear and tear on the drum.
