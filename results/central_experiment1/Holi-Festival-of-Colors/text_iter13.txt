**Color Palette:**

*   Dominant colors are yellow and orange (in clothing and flags), which create a sense of energy and festivity.
*   Other notable colors include brown (in the drum), black (in turbans), and the muted earth tones of the buildings in the background.
*   The Indian flags add green, white, and blue.

**Composition:**

*   The main subject is positioned slightly off-center, which keeps the image dynamic and allows for a view of the crowd and flags behind him.

*   The fabric of the turbans and clothing has a slightly rough texture, with folds and creases.
*   The wood of the drum and drumsticks appears smooth and polished.
*   The buildings have a rough texture, suggesting aged construction materials like brick or concrete.

**Mood or Atmosphere:**
