*   A central figure, an older man with a long white beard and mustache, stands out prominently. He wears a saffron turban with a red mark on his forehead (tilak), a garland of orange flowers around his neck, and holds two wooden sticks up in the air. His expression is joyful and engaged, as he looks directly at the camera with a smile.
*   Two men flank him on either side, with similar attire. The man to the right has a mustache and is holding a small drum.

**Scene Setting:**

*   The scene is outdoors, set in a crowded street in India.
*   Buildings line both sides of the street, including what appears to be a temple or religious structure in the distance, with an ornate gateway.
*   The lighting is diffused, suggesting an overcast day or time around dawn/dusk.
*   The environment is bustling with people, indicating a procession or celebration.
