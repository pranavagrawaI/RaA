Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Primary Subject(s):**

*   **Red Lighthouse:** A single, bright red lighthouse stands prominently on a stone foundation. The lighthouse is cylindrical with a slightly tapered form. It has a red lantern structure at the top, featuring a small railing and a domed roof. Three small, rectangular windows are vertically aligned on the main body of the lighthouse. Its reflection is visible on the water.
*   **Glass Tower:** A modern, tall, glass-clad tower stands on the left side of the frame. The tower is rectangular and consists of multiple stories, each clearly defined by the glazed panels. It is located beside the beach.
*   **Beachgoers:** Many people are scattered across the beach. They are engaged in various activities like sunbathing, swimming, walking, and playing.

**Secondary Objects:**

*   **Beach:** A sandy beach occupies the middle ground between the buildings/towers and the water.
*   **Water:** A body of water, possibly the sea, fills the lower portion of the frame.
*   **Rocks:** Large, jagged rocks are scattered in the foreground along the shoreline.
*   **Buildings:** Residential buildings are situated in the background behind the beach. They vary in color and design.
*   **Sailboats:** Two sailboats can be seen in the distance on the water to the right of the lighthouse.
*   **Clouds:** Fluffy, white cumulus clouds dominate the blue sky.

**Scene Setting:**

*   **Outdoor Environment:** The scene is set outdoors, on a sunny day at the coast.
*   **Lighting:** The lighting is bright and direct, suggesting midday sun. Shadows are crisp and well-defined.
*   **Time of Day:** Appears to be midday due to the strong, overhead light and minimal shadows.

**Color Palette:**

*   **Dominant Colors:** Blue (sky, water), Red (lighthouse), Beige/Yellow (sand), Gray (rocks), Green (grass on the beach).
*   **Notable Colors:** The buildings in the background show a variety of muted colors, including whites, creams, browns, and reds.

**Composition:**

*   **Camera Angle:** Shot from a slightly low angle.
*   **Framing:** The frame is wide, capturing a broad view of the coastal landscape. The composition is divided into thirds, with the rocks occupying the foreground, the beach/structures in the mid-ground, and the sky in the background.
*   **Perspective:** The perspective provides a sense of depth, leading the eye from the foreground rocks to the distant buildings and sailboats.
*   **Object Placement:** The lighthouse and tower are positioned on opposite sides of the frame, balancing the composition. The beachgoers are scattered throughout the mid-ground, adding a sense of activity and life to the scene.

**Style Indicators:**

*   **Photographic:** The image appears to be a photograph, likely taken with a digital camera. There are no clear indicators of filters or artistic effects.

**Textures & Materials:**

*   **Rocks:** Rough, jagged texture of the rocks in the foreground.
*   **Sand:** Smooth, fine texture of the sand on the beach.
*   **Water:** Reflective, slightly rippled texture of the water.
*   **Lighthouse:** Smooth, painted metal of the lighthouse.
