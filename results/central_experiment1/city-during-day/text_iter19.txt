Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Primary subject(s):**

*   A single bright red lighthouse stands prominently in the scene. It is cylindrical with a slightly flared base, a small window visible on its lower portion, and a round structure at the top with a red conical roof and a black railing surrounding it. The lighthouse is stark, clean, and well-maintained.

**Secondary objects:**

*   **Rocks:** The lighthouse sits on a foundation of large grey rocks, providing a stark textural contrast to the smooth, red structure.
*   **Beach:** A sandy beach stretches behind the lighthouse. It is populated with numerous people enjoying the sunny day. Many are lounging on towels, others are walking along the shore, and some are in the water. The figures are small and contribute to the overall sense of a busy summer day.
*   **Buildings:** In the background, behind the beach, are several buildings, including hotels and houses. They are various shades of light beige and grey.
*   **Sky:** A bright blue sky fills the upper portion of the frame. It is populated with puffy white clouds.
*   **Water:** Calm, slightly choppy water fills the foreground. A reflection of the red lighthouse is visible on the water's surface.
