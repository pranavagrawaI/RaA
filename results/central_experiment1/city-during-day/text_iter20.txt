**Secondary Objects:**

*   A sandy beach is visible behind the lighthouse, populated with numerous people enjoying the day. Individuals are standing, sitting, and swimming, engaging in various beach activities. Several colorful beach umbrellas and towels are scattered across the sand.
*   Behind the beach, several houses are visible, characterized by classic New England architectural styles. These houses feature light-colored siding, dark roofs, and numerous windows.
*   The water in the foreground reflects the red color of the lighthouse.
*   A blue sky filled with numerous white, fluffy cumulus clouds occupies the upper portion of the frame.

**Scene Setting:**

*   The scene is outdoors. The setting appears to be a coastal area with a lighthouse situated at the edge of a harbor or inlet.

**Composition:**
