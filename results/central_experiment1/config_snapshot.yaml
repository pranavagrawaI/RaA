  caption: "Describe this image in detailed, structured prose so that another model\
    \ could reproduce it as faithfully as possible. Your description **must** include:\n\
    \u2022 Primary subject(s) - identity, count, appearance, pose, expression\n\u2022\
    \ Secondary objects - any items or beings within the frame and their relation\
    \ to the subject\n\u2022 Scene setting - indoor/outdoor, environment, lighting\
    \ conditions, time of day\n\u2022 Color palette - dominant and notable colours\
    \ of all main elements\n\u2022 Composition - camera angle, framing, perspective,\
    \ depth cues, object placement\n\u2022 Style indicators - if artistic, specify\
    \ medium (e.g., watercolor, digital painting); if photographic, note lens/filters\
    \ (if guessable)\n\u2022 Textures & materials - of major surfaces (e.g., skin,\
    \ fabric, metal, grass)\n\u2022 Mood or atmosphere - if emotionally evocative\n\
    Do **not** omit details due to assumed irrelevance. Write as if the description\
    \ will be used to reconstruct the image from scratch."
