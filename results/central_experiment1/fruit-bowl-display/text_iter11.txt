    *   Three oranges: Round with textured, vibrant orange peel. One is partially visible amongst the other fruits, and the other two oranges are sitting near the front.
    *   A small bunch of purple grapes: Located at the back of the bowl, adding visual variety with their dark color and clustered arrangement.

**Secondary objects:**

*   **Wooden Bowl:** A round, light brown wooden bowl holds the fruit. The grain of the wood is subtly visible.
*   **Table:** The bowl sits on a wooden table with a light brown color.

*   **Environment:** The background is a plain gray wall, offering a neutral backdrop that highlights the colors and textures of the fruits and wooden elements.
