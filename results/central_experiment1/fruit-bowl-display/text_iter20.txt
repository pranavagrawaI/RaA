**Primary Subject(s):**

*   **Oranges:** There are three oranges in total. Two are visible on the table, and the other is inside a bowl. All are round with a bumpy, bright orange peel. The peel texture appears slightly rough.
*   **Apples:** Four red apples, all located inside the bowl. They are round and smooth with a glossy red skin and a small stem.
*   **Plums:** Three plums are placed on the table. They have a round shape, a smooth skin, and a mix of purple and red coloring.
*   **Grapes:** A cluster of dark purple grapes sits on the table between the plums and the pear.
*   **Pear:** A single yellow pear sits on the table to the right of the grapes. It has a smooth skin with some speckled brown spots.

**Secondary Objects:**

*   **Wooden Bowl:** A light-colored wooden bowl containing the oranges and apples. It has visible wood grain. The bowl sits in the middle of the table.
*   **Chair:** A light-colored wooden chair is behind the bowl, partially obscuring the background. Only the upper portion of the chair is visible, including the back and rungs.

**Scene Setting:**
