*   **Oranges:** Four oranges. They are round, textured, and bright orange, positioned around the other fruits.
*   **Pear:** One yellow pear, situated centrally in the bowl.
*   **Grapes:** A bunch of dark purple grapes sits on the right side of the bowl, towards the back. The grapes are round and cluster together.

**Secondary Objects:**

*   **Wooden Bowl:** A light brown wooden bowl holds the fruit. The bowl has a simple, rounded shape.
*   **Placemat:** A rectangular beige placemat beneath the bowl provides a textured surface. It appears to be made of woven material.

**Color Palette:**

*   **Dominant Colors:** Light brown, beige, red, orange, yellow, and purple.
