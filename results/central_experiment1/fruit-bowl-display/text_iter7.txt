*   **Apples:** There are two red apples, seemingly of the Gala or Fuji variety, with smooth, shiny skins. They are positioned on the left side of the bowl, partially overlapping each other. The apples have minimal blemishes and feature a healthy red hue with slight yellow undertones.
*   **Pears:** There are two pears, appearing to be yellow Bartlett pears. They are light yellow with subtle brown spots and a slender stem. One is slightly hidden behind the other.
*   **Oranges:** Two oranges are present. They are a vibrant orange color with a textured, slightly bumpy skin characteristic of citrus fruits. The oranges are roughly spherical.
*   **Grapes:** A bunch of dark purple grapes is nestled on the right side of the bowl. The grapes are plump and round, clustered together tightly.

**Secondary Objects:**

*   **Wooden Bowl:** A large, light-brown wooden bowl contains the fruit. The bowl has a simple, rounded design and a smooth, polished surface. The texture of the wood grain is visible.
*   **Placemat:** A brown, woven placemat sits beneath the bowl, providing a surface for it to rest on. The texture of the weaving is apparent.
*   **Wooden Chair:** The back of a light-colored wooden chair is visible in the background. The chair has a simple, slatted design.
