Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Primary subject(s):**
The primary subject is a single sea turtle, likely a green sea turtle due to the coloration of its shell and skin. It is positioned facing directly forward, with its front flippers outstretched on the sand. Its expression is neutral, and it appears calm and centered. On top of its shell is an arrangement of roughly 20-25 pink roses, forming a circular crown or headdress.

**Secondary objects:**
In the background is a beach with white sand. Behind the beach is turquoise water with small waves breaking near the shoreline. In the far distance, the horizon line is visible with a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy, white cumulus clouds. A small dark figure, presumably a person swimming or standing, is visible in the water on the left side of the frame.

**Scene setting:**
The scene is set on a tropical beach on a sunny day. The environment consists of white sand, clear turquoise water, and a blue sky with white clouds. The lighting conditions are bright and sunny, with soft shadows cast by the turtle on the sand. The time of day appears to be midday or early afternoon. The setting is outdoors.
