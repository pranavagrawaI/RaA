Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Primary Subject:**
The primary subject is a single sea turtle. It has a grey-blue shell adorned with approximately 20 light pink roses arranged across its carapace. The turtle's skin is a darker shade of blue-grey, with intricate patterns on its head and flippers. The turtle is facing slightly to the right, appearing to be mid-stride on the sand. Its expression is serene and focused.

**Secondary Objects:**
The secondary object is a large wave breaking in the background. It's a vibrant turquoise color, with white foam cresting along the top and cascading down its face. The wave dominates the upper portion of the background. In the immediate background, the ocean recedes in foamy ripples towards the horizon.

**Scene Setting:**
The scene is set on a sandy beach, outdoors. The lighting is bright and diffused, suggesting a sunny day with possible light cloud cover. The time of day appears to be mid-day.

**Color Palette:**
The dominant colors are:
- Sand: Light beige to tan
- Turtle: Grey-blue, with lighter grey undersides
- Roses: Light pink with hints of cream
- Ocean: Turquoise, with white foam
- Sky: Light grey-blue

**Composition:**
The camera angle is at eye level with the turtle, providing a medium shot that emphasizes both the turtle and its environment. The framing is balanced, with the turtle slightly off-center to the left, allowing the breaking wave to be prominently displayed in the background. Perspective is moderate, with the size of the wave diminishing towards the horizon, creating depth. The turtle is placed in the foreground, the beach in the mid-ground, and the wave and ocean in the background, all contributing to a layered composition.

**Style Indicators:**
The image appears to be a digitally manipulated photograph, likely with some enhancements to color and sharpness. There are no obvious signs of filters or special lenses, though some sharpening may have been applied to enhance textures.

**Textures & Materials:**
- Turtle shell: Smooth, with segmented plates
- Turtle skin: Scaly and leathery
- Roses: Soft, velvety petals
- Sand: Fine, granular texture
- Water: Smooth surface with foamy texture at crests

**Mood or Atmosphere:**
The overall mood is peaceful and whimsical. The contrast between the natural strength of the turtle and the delicate beauty of the roses creates a sense of unexpected harmony. The breaking wave adds a dynamic element, while the serene expression of the turtle contributes to a calming atmosphere.
