Here is a detailed description of the image:

**Primary subject(s):**

*   **Sea Turtle:** A single, large sea turtle is the focal point. It has a brown and reddish-brown carapace (shell) adorned with a circular arrangement of pink roses. The shell's surface appears textured, possibly with a natural pattern. Its head and limbs are a blend of tan and brown, patterned with darker geometric shapes on the flippers. The turtle's eyes are round and dark, appearing calm. It's posed on a sandy beach, facing slightly towards the left of the frame.

**Secondary objects:**

*   **Pink Roses:** Approximately a dozen pink roses are arranged around the edge of the turtle's carapace, forming a floral crown. The roses appear to be fresh and in full bloom.
*   **Beach:** The turtle rests on a light beige sandy beach. The sand appears smooth and fine-grained.
*   **Ocean:** In the background, the turquoise ocean stretches out to the horizon. White waves are visible breaking on the shore.
*   **Sky:** The sky is bright blue with a few scattered white clouds.

**Scene setting:**
