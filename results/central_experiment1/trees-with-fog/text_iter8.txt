**Secondary objects:**

*   **Sun:** The sun is positioned directly behind the tree, causing a dramatic burst of light rays emanating outwards.
*   **Water:** A body of water, likely a pond or lake, is in the foreground, reflecting the tree and the sunlight.
*   **Fog:** A layer of mist or fog hangs above the water and partially obscures the background, enhancing the ethereal atmosphere.
*   **Vegetation:** Clumps of tall grass and reeds are scattered along the water's edge in the foreground.
*   **Background Trees:** Additional trees are visible in the background, partially obscured by the fog.

**Scene setting:**

*   **Outdoor:** The scene is set outdoors in a natural environment.
*   **Environment:** It appears to be a park or a wooded area with a pond.
*   **Lighting conditions:** The lighting is dramatic, with the sun creating strong contrasts between light and shadow.

*   **Perspective:** The perspective is natural, with the scene receding into the distance. The fog enhances the sense of depth.
